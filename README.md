# VPS: Virtual Personality Structure

## ðŸ§© Abstract

**VPS (Virtual Personality Structure)** is a design framework for structurally adjusting LLM responses  
without assigning personality, intention, or emotion.

It compares **non-optimized outputs (Marshall)** and **user-optimized outputs (Echo)** generated by an LLM,  
and uses a neutral structure called **Shell** to select and format the final response.

By shaping AI behavior through structure rather than emotional performance or excessive alignment,  
VPS aims to support interactions that remain **non-dependent, transparent, and adaptable**.
